# Dynamic Belief System Experiment Plan

## Initial Findings & Strategy Update

### Key Discoveries
1. Pattern Memory Persistence
   - System shows natural resistance to complete pattern erasure
   - Patterns decay gracefully rather than binary pruning
   - Strong patterns remain stable while weak patterns fade
   - System maintains a form of "long-term memory"

2. Pattern Interaction Characteristics
   - Pattern strength influences learning rate
   - Temporal decay affects pattern importance
   - Frequency and recency both contribute to pattern strength
   - Natural emergence of pattern hierarchies

3. System Limitations
   - No effective transitive learning (A→B, B→C doesn't imply A→C)
   - Pattern dilution in dense networks
   - Limited pattern prioritization
   - Over-emphasis on stability

### Strategy Adjustment
Moving from binary pattern pruning to activation-based approach:
- Patterns exist in active/inactive states rather than being completely pruned
- Pattern strength determines influence on system behavior
- Focus on managing pattern interference rather than elimination
- Embrace memory persistence as a feature
