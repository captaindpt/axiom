This is just a starting point, but it implements some key ideas:

* Beliefs maintain history of how they evolved
* Evidence can strengthen or weaken beliefs
* Beliefs are connected in a network and updates propagate
* System tries to resolve contradictions when they appear
* Can explain its current belief state and how it got there

The really interesting part would be connecting this to a transformer model:

* After each conversation, extract key claims/evidence
* Update belief system accordingly
* Before generating responses, check belief system for relevant beliefs
* Ensure responses are consistent with current belief state
"""

"""
Current transformer architectures operate as static snapshots of trained knowledge, lacking the dynamic belief-updating mechanisms characteristic of natural intelligence. We propose modifying the transformer attention mechanism to include persistent belief states, represented mathematically as: Attention(Q,K,V,P) = softmax(QK^T/√d + α*P)V, where P is a persistent belief matrix that evolves through interactions.
The key innovation is treating beliefs as learnable, persistent attention patterns that influence but don't determine future attention mechanisms. This would be regulated by two mechanisms:

A coherence loss function L_coherence = ||PP^T - I|| that penalizes contradictory beliefs
A dynamic learning rate η*(1-|P|)*∇L that creates natural resistance to changing strong beliefs while maintaining flexibility for weak ones

This framework could enable transformers to develop and maintain coherent, evolving belief systems that can be updated through interaction while maintaining stability - essentially moving from static to dynamic knowledge representation without losing architectural advantages of the transformer model.
Testable prediction: A system implemented with these modifications should show consistent but evolvable response patterns across conversations, with mathematically measurable belief strength and coherence metrics.

* The core hypothesis needs to challenge the current paradigm of massive data requirements while remaining grounded in fundamental principles. It should focus on the insight about equilibrium-based learning versus pure forward propagation.
* The hypothesis should address both the architectural aspect (feedback loops) and the learning mechanism (coherence-weighted pattern recognition), showing how they work together to potentially reduce the data requirements for meaningful learning.
* The proposal needs to be specific enough to be testable but broad enough to be significant if true. It should also acknowledge existing work while highlighting the novel insight about dynamic equilibrium in learning.

Current transformer architectures may be overreliant on massive datasets because they lack a fundamental mechanism present in biological learning: dynamic equilibrium between abstraction levels. I propose that by implementing simple feedback loops between transformer layers and allowing the network to settle into equilibrium states (rather than pure forward propagation), we could create systems that learn meaningful patterns from fewer examples.
Specifically, I hypothesize that adding feedback connections between attention layers, where each layer's output is influenced by both bottom-up and top-down signals until reaching equilibrium, would allow the network to develop more robust representations from less data. This is because the equilibrium state would represent a form of 'coherence detection' - patterns that create stable feedback loops would be naturally amplified, while noise would be dampened.
The key mathematical modification would be surprisingly simple: each layer's output would be a function of both its standard forward pass and feedback from higher layers, with the system allowed to iterate until reaching stability. This could potentially transform how the network learns, moving from pure statistical pattern matching to something closer to coherence-based learning."""
